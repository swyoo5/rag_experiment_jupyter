The thymus is responsible for the development and maturation of T-cells, which are essential for cell-mediated immunity. During early life, the thymus is large and active, reaching its peak size during puberty. After puberty, the thymus begins to involute, meaning it shrinks in size and becomes less active. This involution is a normal part of aging and is associated with a decline in immune function. The thymus also produces hormones like thymosin, which help in the maturation of T-cells.
